## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

You can style components like links even they aren't links. Define a class, in my case ".link" and just style it with:

```
.link:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I think I will definitely use this for my own links page. Just make all the bullets links and insert all my various web properties that I want people to know about.
